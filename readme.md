This repository just noted for reminding how to set up Deep learning server.   

I explain about,  
1. [How to set up server using Anaconda](https://github.com/hololee/How-to-set-up-deeplearning-server/blob/main/anaconda.md)
2. [How to set up server using Docker](https://github.com/hololee/How-to-set-up-deeplearning-server/blob/main/docker.md)

Before starting, you should prepare below environment.  
- Ubuntu installed PC (Ubuntu 18.04 LTS ver is used here.)
- Nvidia GPU (Nvidia GTX 960@2G is used here.)
- If you want to using server in your home, need to set up prot forwarding using Home Router.
